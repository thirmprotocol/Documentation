T-Tokens are tokenized cryptocurrencies by Thirm VM. Each T-Token is 100% verifiable and backed by its native cryptocurrency (e.g., 1 tBTC = 1 BTC). T-Tokens can be used like any normal ERC20 token, which means they will work in all Ethereum Based Applications. They can be locked, lent, borrowed, traded, or used in more complex logics.

## Incentives

They may also provide opportunities for arbitrage, the simultaneous buying, and selling of securities, currencies, or commodities across different markets or in derivative forms in order to take advantage of differing prices for the same asset.

Providing LP for T-Tokens will earn rewards directly from Uniswap and other DEXs themselves.

## Supply

T-TOKENS are minted and burned on demand depending on the DAPP users’ Deposits or Withdrawals, thus the supply is highly dynamic.
