Governance allow token holders to help shape the future of a protocol. Governance token holders can influence decisions concerning the project such as proposing or deciding on new feature proposals and even changing the governance system itself. In many cases, the changes proposed, discussed, and then voted on through on-chain governance accessed by using governance tokens are applied automatically through smart contracts. In other cases, the team maintaining the project is tasked with applying the changes or hiring someone who will.

Proponents of systems that use governance tokens believe that they allow for user control, which holds true to the original cryptocurrency ideals of decentralization and democratization. In most cases, organizations that let users control the development of their systems are called decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).
